## Introduction to React Props and PropTypes

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of props and PropTypes in a React application. The application consists of a main component (`App.jsx`) that renders multiple instances of a `Student` component, each with different prop values. Additionally, it showcases how to set default prop values and validate prop types using PropTypes.

### [App.jsx](./src/App.jsx)

The `App.jsx` file serves as the main component of the application. It imports the `Student` component and PropTypes, then renders several `Student` components with different props.

```javascript
import Student from "./Student";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Student name="SpongeBob" age={30} isStudent={true} />
      <Student name="Patrick" age={42} isStudent={false} />
      <Student name="Squidward" age={50} isStudent={false} />
      <Student name="Sandy" age={27} isStudent={true} />
      <Student />
    </>
  );
}

Student.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest",
  age: 0,
  isStudent: false,
};

Student.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string,
  age: PropTypes.number,
  isStudent: PropTypes.bool,
};

export default App;
```

- **Imports**: The `App` component imports the `Student` component and `PropTypes`.
- **Component Instances**: It renders multiple `Student` components with various prop values.
- **Default Props**: Defines default prop values for `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`.
- **Prop Types**: Specifies the expected data types for the `name`, `age`, and `isStudent` props.

### Understanding Props

Props, short for properties, are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent components to child components in React. They allow components to be dynamic and reusable by customizing their behavior and appearance based on the values received.

#### Key Points About Props:
- **Data Transfer**: Props are used to transfer data from a parent component to a child component.
- **Read-Only**: Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the child component receiving them.
- **Customizable Components**: By passing different prop values, you can create flexible and reusable components.

##### Example:
```javascript
<Student name="SpongeBob" age={30} isStudent={true} />
```
In this example, the `Student` component receives three props: `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`. These props customize the content displayed by the `Student` component.

### Setting Default Props

Default props are fallback values assigned to props if they are not provided by the parent component. This ensures that the component has some default behavior or appearance even when certain props are missing.

#### Example:
```javascript
Student.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest",
  age: 0,
  isStudent: false,
};
```
If the `Student` component is rendered without any props, it will use these default values.

### Validating Props with PropTypes

PropTypes is a mechanism to ensure that the props passed to a component are of the correct data type. This helps catch bugs and ensure that the component is used correctly.

#### Example:
```javascript
Student.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string,
  age: PropTypes.number,
  isStudent: PropTypes.bool,
};
```
This example ensures that the `name` prop is a string, the `age` prop is a number, and the `isStudent` prop is a boolean. If the wrong data type is passed, a warning will be displayed in the console.

### [Student.jsx](./src/Student.jsx)

The `Student.jsx` file defines a `Student` component that displays a student's name, age, and whether they are a student.

```javascript
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */

function Student(props) {
  return (
    <div className="student">
      <p>Name: {props.name} </p>
      <p>Age: {props.age} </p>
      <p>Student: {props.isStudent ? "Yes" : "No"} </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Student;
```

- **Function Definition**: The `Student` function takes `props` as an argument and returns a JSX structure.
- **JSX Return**: It returns a `div` containing three paragraphs that display the `name`, `age`, and `isStudent` prop values.

### [index.css](./src/index.css)

The `index.css` file contains the CSS styles for the application. It defines styles for the `.student` class and its child `p` elements.

```css
.student {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid hsla(0, 0%, 50%, 0.8);
}

.student p {
  margin: 0;
}
```

- **Styles for .student**: Sets the font, font size, padding, and border for elements with the `student` class.
- **Styles for .student p**: Removes the margin for `p` elements within a `student` class.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use props to pass data between components in React, set default prop values, and validate prop types using PropTypes. The `App` component renders multiple `Student` components with different props, showcasing the flexibility and power of props in building dynamic React applications.

- **Props**: Enable data sharing between parent and child components.
- **PropTypes**: Ensure that props are of the correct data type, enhancing type safety.
- **Default Props**: Provide default values for props, ensuring components have fallback values.
